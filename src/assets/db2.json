Imagine a community bound together by wealth and power – of royal Indian princes, political leaders and pioneering industrialists. Imagine a neighbourhood that has retained its legendary charm long after the clang of hooves made way for the swish of alloy wheels. Imagine the finest address for the country’s most powerful. At the highest point of Altamount Road, a new landmark rises where once stood Washington House, former residence of the Consul General of the United States. Presiding over South Mumbai from its vantage point, Lodha Altamount is a vision in glass, providing its influential residents absolute privacy from the public gaze, while allowing unrestricted views of the Arabian Sea and the city beneath.",
